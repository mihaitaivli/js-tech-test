## Running instructions

In order to run the app open a terminal in the root of the application
and execute `npm start` - this will run the docker images, build the app and start it.

By default it will run on http://localhost:5000 but it will inform you if the port is already in use. It will not start the browser automatically though.

For development purposes navigate to the `client` dir and run `npm start`

## Tech stack
